Onken
=====

Onken is a tool for managing orders for RoboJackets, a student organization at Georgia Tech.

## Motivation

For many years RoboJackets' ordering system has been run by a system of linked spreadsheets that have become difficult to manage. This project aims to replace those spreadsheets.

## Getting Help
For help with development, open an issue on GitHub or ask in the #onken channel in the SCC Slack workspace.

## Getting Started Locally
For help getting started, look at the local development section in [Apiary's readme](https://github.com/RoboJackets/apiary/blob/master/README.md#getting-started-with-local-development). Onken has a similar structure to Apiary, but does not have an API at this point.
